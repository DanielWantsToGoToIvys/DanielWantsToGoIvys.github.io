                <p class="intro" style="color: white;">Hi, I'm Santiago and I am currently in my 11th year of high 
                school. I creating things and coding in my free time. Most of the things that I know regarding 
                this is self taught. The languages I am most familiar with working with are Python, CSS, HTML, 
                and GDScript. Currently in AP CSP we are working on 3 projects; this website and 2 games.</p>

                <p class="zom-cont" style="color: white;">Contributions to the zombie game:</p>
                <p class="zom-p" style="color: white;">I developed the player movement and code myself. I also helped everyone else
                learn godot game engine as they did not know how it worked. I assisted in developing the main menu. 
                I helped here and there in other parts of the game too with coding.</p>

        <div class="cont2">
                <p class="pong" style="color: white;">Contributions to gun pong:</p>
                <p class="pongcont" style="color: white;">In the pong game I made the ball and coded much of the physics
                that the ball follows so it bounces. I also developed the functionality of the paddle and the ability for it
                to break apart. Ishaan made the paddle movement. I also created the goals and the ability for it to detect 
                if the ball was entering it.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="cont3">
                <p class="website" style="color: white;">Contributions to the website:</p>
                <p class="webcont" style="color: white;">In the beginning of the development of the website I played a big 
                role in figuring out how HTML and CSS work so that we could produce a great website. I also provided the functionality 
                to the menu button that is on our website. Though, Daniel is the one that added all the buttons inside of it.</p>
