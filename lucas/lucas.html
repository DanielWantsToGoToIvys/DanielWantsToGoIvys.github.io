    <h1>Welcome to Lucas's page</h1>
    <p>Hi this is a very poorly designed webpage lol</p>
    <h2>Project Contributions</h2>
    <h3>Team Webpage</h3>
        <li>I'm the backend developer so I made all the backend features with PHP, which includes a login and account management system. I'm planning on putting member profiles and contributions in the database in the future.</li>
        <li>I also made the <a href="../projects/projects.html">pages for our projects.</a> You can read more about all our contributions there.</a></li>
    <h3>Zombie Shooter Game</h3>
        <li>I initally didn't have a role in this project, but then I got assigned to work on powerups, so I implemented those.</li>
        <li>I also helped fix bugs and issues in the game, some related to powerups, some not.</li>
    
    <h2>My coding knowledge/experience</h2>
    <li>I know HTML and Javascript</li>
    <li>Terrible CSS skills, as you can tell from this page</li>
    <li>Basic knowledge of Java and maybe some Python (I haven't used Python in like 4 years)</li>
    <li>Some knowledge of C sharp (I made the last three levels in the school's game, <a href="https://ahs-game-development-club.itch.io/eagle-quest">Eagle Quest</a>)</li>
