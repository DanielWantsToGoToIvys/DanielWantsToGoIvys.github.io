  <h4>Mr.Millard - Period 4</h4>
  <p>I am my team's tech support and the event planner for Period 4. If someone on my team encounters an error, it is my job to find them a solution, find someone else who can give them a solution, or, my favoirte, use AI to find a solution (Reason why I like this class best). Ever since my team and I began a project, they have very well understood the usefulness of my role and how much I am able to contribute to the team. My skills include Python as my most proficient skill, and a bit of HTML, Javascript, CSS, C++, and Java. Let me emphasize that again, "a little bit." However, my skills may not be the best I definitely take time to strengthen my skills during class time.</p>
